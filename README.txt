Classic Pacman


How to play?
Collect the pellets (white circles) to earn points! By collecting all
of the pellets, you will be able to proceed to the next level.

By collecting the large pellet, Pacman will power up and be able to
eat the ghosts for even more points. Make sure to avoid touching the
ghosts when Pacman isn't powered up.
